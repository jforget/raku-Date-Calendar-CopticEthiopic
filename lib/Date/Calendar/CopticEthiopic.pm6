=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Calendar::CopticEthiopic is a  module distribution providing two
classes,  Date::Calendar::Coptic   and  Date::Calendar::Ethiopic.  The
corresponding  calendars   both  derive  from  the   ancient  Egyptian
calendar. In  each, a year  consists of 12  months with 30  days each,
plus 5 or 6  additional days (epagomene) at the end  of the year. Leap
years occurs every fourth year,  with no adjustment for century years.
The calendars  also define weeks which  last for 7 days,  beginning on
sunday and ending on saturday.

See the full documentation in each class.
